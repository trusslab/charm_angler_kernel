    msm: camera: don't cut to 8bits for validating enum variable
    
    In msm_ispif_is_intf_valid(),
    we convert a enum variable msm_ispif_vfe_intf,
    to uint8_t type for validating.
    
    This could cause potential issue,
    if the value is crafted in such a way that lower 8bits pass the validation.
    
    Don't use uint8_t as input parm to avoid such vulnerability.

    msm: camera: isp: Fix for CAMIF error
    
    While changing resolution, ISPIF and ISP hardware need to be reset
    to work properly. In the reset hw logic, Some clocks and registers
    are not reset properly, This causes some IRQ interruots triggered
    whenever changing resolution.
    
    This change fix the Epoch registers with correct line numbers
    during reset and reset clock is called during close node.

    Change pr_err to pr_err_ratelimited in default
    case prints of userspace ioctl. pr_err would
    keep printing when passing wrong parameters in ioctl
    which will cause watchdog reset.

    msm: camera: Non-busy polling and timeout when stopping ISPIF.
    
    Previously a busy loop used to wait for ISPIF stop on frame
    boundary. This was bad not only for busy polling, but
    because if sensor has stopped streaming for some reason, the ISPIF
    will never stop thus making the loop endless.
    The new solution uses readl_poll_timeout macro, polling once in
    millisecond for maximum of 500 milliseconds (which corresponds to
    2FPS - minimum supported frame rate). If polling times out, driver
    reports the error to the user space for appropriate recovery.

      ISPIF driver needs to know HW version of ISPIF module and number of
      ISPs to which it is connected in order to execute proper reset of
      ISPIF module. For this purpose, two optional properties for these
      are added to ISPIF node. Both properties are optional - if not

    2. Resets ISPIF HW
      Force hardware reset during hardware start to ensure
      all the line buffers are cleared. Reset is done once after first
      open of the module. In order to reset module clocks of CSID and ISPs
      connected to it should be enabled.

    msm: camera: Do not do HW reset of the ISPIF
    
    There is no real need to reset the ISPIF, as all the ISPIF reset is
    doing is to reset the registers to default values. But there are too
    many problems trying to do a reset of the ISPIF as it requires all the
    clocks from CSID and all clocks from every VFE interface to complete the
    reset. Because of this it simpler to replace the HW reset with a SW one,
    where the registers are set to the default value.
    
    The only place where ISPIF driver explicitly requires clocks to be
    enabled is when reset is performed. Because the ISPIF needs only the
    ispif_ahb_clk clock to be programmed there is also no need to keep the
    request for the other clocks in the driver. So we can leave this job to
    the CSID and VFE blocks themselves.
    
    This way only the ispif_ahb_clk clock enable requests will be done by
    the ISPIF and the other clock enable requests will be left to the CSID
    and VFE drivers per device only when they are used and really needed.
    This will be enough for the ISPIF to work as desired, as there is no
    time when the ISPIF can work alone without the CSID and/or VFE running
    in the same time.

    msm: camera: Request ispif_ahb_clk in ISPIF driver
    
    ISPIF device needs to have "ispif_ahb_clk" clock when, there is a
    register accesses. If this clock is not turned on and a register access
    happens the following L2 master port error will happen:
    
      <1> L2 Error detected!
      <1> **L2ESR    = 0x00010001
      <1> **L2ESYNR0 = 0x19002008
      <1> **L2ESYNR1 = 0x00409508
      <1> **L2EAR0   = 0x00028106
      <1> **L2EAR1   = 0x00000001
      <1> **CPU bitmap = 0x1
      <1> L2 master port decode error
      <6> coresight-tmc fc307000.tmc: TMC aborted
      <0> Kernel panic - not syncing: L2 master port error detected
    
    Before this patch this request was left to be done by the CSID and
    CSIPHY drivers, as they also need this clock. This provides a
    possibility of a race condition, where the userspace, might request not
    in sync the drivers and they might not enable the clocks in the correct
    order. In such a case the ISPIF device might be left without clocks
    being enabled, while a transaction to its register is about to be done,
    which will result in the above kernel panic. To prevent this issue, the
    ISPIF driver requests the required clock on its own without depending on
    other drivers to do so.

    success. In order to prevent usage of the above commands in this
    situation, just provide a check for the ISPIF and return -EPERM error

    msm: camera: Use info about VFEs in ISPIF
    
    There can be SoCs which have different amount of VFEs connected to
    ISPIF, while the CSID version is kept the same. For such cases there is
    a need to have additional information about the number of VFEs connected
    to each ISPIF interface, and its capabilities.
    
    As there is no way for the ISPIF to guess this information on its own,
    this change introduces a new ISPIF ioctl cmd, called ISPIF_SET_VFE_INFO.
    This command will store the information for the number of VFEs connected
    and also VFEs capabilities.
    
    The above information is used where number of VFEs information is
    required. Such places are vfe clock request, ISPIF irq handling and
    others.

    msm: camera: separate clk enable in ispif
    
    ISPIF driver should request VFE clocks on a need bases. It is generally
    not a good idea to request all the possible clocks at open time, and
    free them at close. For this reason the ISPIF driver is modified to
    request only the clock which are really needed at some moment for its
    operation. This includes clock requests for VFE0 and VFE1 at init time
    when the reset should happen, and release them immediately after that.
    
    Also to ensure the normal working when there is a request for operation
    with the ISPIF, the clocks are enabled and disabled immediately. The
    reason for this is that VFE clocks are enabled by the VFE when there is
    a need of VFE, and the ISPIF only requires the clocks when it is being
    configured. In all other cases the VFE will take care of enabling them.

    msm: ispif: Protect shared resource
    
    Add a spinlock and a boolen wait_timeout to protect shared resource
    between IRQ handle and userspace IOCTL access. There should have no

    Remove the '#define CONFIG_MSMB_CAMERA_DEBUG' found at the top of

    excessive informational/debugging prints that contributed a lot of
    noise to the kernel logs.

    msm: msmb: ISP interface driver and ISP driver implementation
    
    (1) ISP interface(ISPIF) sits between sensor(CSID) and ISP.
        It's responsible to mux sensor's output path to
        ISP input path. ISPIF driver contains two parts, i.e.,
        user space driver and kernel driver. The kernel driver is
        mainly for register write and read.
    
    (2) Image signal processing(ISP) driver's responsiblity is to
        processed the sensor's raw image to generate the YUV image
        for rending/video encoding and snapshot. ISP driver has
        following main functional blcoks:
        - Image bus(AXI) management and configuration
        - ISP processing pipeline configuration and run time update
        - ISP input interface(CAMIF) configuration
        - Image buffer management
        - ISP interrupt handling
        - ISP kernel event notification to user space
        - ISP hardware start/stop state machine.
        This patch implemented the ISP kernel driver.
